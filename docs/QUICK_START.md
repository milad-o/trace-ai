# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

## Get Started in 3 Minutes

### 1. **Ask a Question**
```bash
uv run trace-ai ask ./examples/sample_packages \
  "What documents do we have?"
```

### 2. **Create a Visualization**
```bash
uv run trace-ai ask ./examples/sample_packages \
  "Create a hierarchical visualization of the CustomerETL package in SVG format"

# View the result
open data/visualizations/CustomerETL.svg
```

### 3. **Interactive Session**
```bash
uv run trace-ai analyze ./examples/sample_packages

# Then ask multiple questions:
# - "What tasks are in CustomerETL?"
# - "Trace the data lineage for the Customer table"
# - "Create visualizations for both packages"
# - "/stats" to see graph statistics
# - "/quit" to exit
```

## What Can I Do?

### üìä **Visualizations**
```
"Create a hierarchical visualization of [package_name] in SVG format"
"Generate a spring layout diagram showing data flow connections"
"Create PNG images for all packages"
```

### üîç **Analysis**
```
"What tables are used in CustomerETL?"
"Trace data lineage for the Sales table"
"What will be impacted if I modify the Customer table?"
"Show me all task dependencies in SalesAggregation"
```

### üìã **Complex Queries** (Agent uses planning)
```
"Create visualizations for all packages and compare their structures"
"Analyze all data flows and generate a comprehensive report"
"Find all tables accessed across all packages"
```

### üìà **Statistics**
```
"Show me statistics about the knowledge graph"
"How many packages, tasks, and tables do we have?"
"/stats" (in interactive mode)
```
