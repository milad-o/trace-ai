- ❌ No approval workflow
- ❌ No dangerous operation detection

**Scenarios that need it:**
- Graph modifications
- File system operations
- External API calls
- Large-scale deletions

### 6. **Long-term Memory & Session Persistence** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**What we're missing:**
- ❌ No conversation history across sessions
- ❌ No user preference storage
- ❌ No checkpointing
- ❌ No ability to resume analysis later
- ❌ No learning from past interactions

### 7. **Advanced Analysis Capabilities** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**What we're missing:**
- ❌ No performance analysis (bottleneck detection)
- ❌ No cost estimation (data transfer, compute)
- ❌ No optimization suggestions
- ❌ No anomaly detection
- ❌ No comparative analysis (compare two packages)
- ❌ No versioning/change tracking
- ❌ No impact simulation ("what if" scenarios)

### 8. **Output Generation** ⚠️ LIMITED

**What we have:**
- ✅ Text responses (markdown)
- ✅ Can use virtual file system tools

**What we're missing:**
- ❌ No PDF report generation
- ❌ No HTML dashboard
- ❌ No Excel exports
- ❌ No PowerPoint slides
- ❌ No automated documentation
- ❌ No data flow diagrams (SVG/PNG)

### 9. **Multi-Document Analysis** ⚠️ BASIC

**What we have:**
- ✅ Can load multiple packages
- ✅ Combined knowledge graph

**What we're missing:**
- ❌ No cross-package comparison
- ❌ No duplicate detection
- ❌ No consistency checking
- ❌ No dependency conflict detection
- ❌ No architectural patterns detection

### 10. **Real-time Collaboration** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**What we're missing:**
- ❌ No multi-user support
- ❌ No shared sessions
- ❌ No team workspaces
- ❌ No audit logging
- ❌ No role-based access control

## 🤔 MY QUESTIONS FOR YOU

### **Architecture & Design:**

1. **Graph Visualization Priority:**
   - Do you want the agent to generate graph visualizations (SVG/PNG)?
   - Should it be interactive (web-based) or static images?
   - What layout algorithm? (hierarchical, force-directed, circular)

2. **Conversational Memory:**
   - How long should conversations be remembered?
   - Should memory persist across CLI restarts?
   - Should the agent learn user preferences over time?

3. **Planning & Task Breakdown:**
   - Should the agent explicitly show its plan before executing?
   - Do you want to approve the plan before execution?
   - Should it use `write_todos` for complex multi-step queries?

### **Subagent Strategy:**

4. **Which specialists do you need most?**
   - Data Lineage Analyst (trace data flows in detail)
   - Impact Assessment Expert (what breaks if X changes)
   - Documentation Writer (auto-generate docs)
   - Graph Visualizer (create diagrams)
   - Query Optimizer (suggest better ways to query)

5. **Subagent scope:**
   - Should subagents have access to ALL tools or restricted sets?
   - Should they use different models (e.g., GPT-4 for complex, GPT-3.5 for simple)?

### **Real-World Usage:**

6. **What scenarios are you facing that we can't handle yet?**
   - Example: "I need to see which tables are used across 50 packages"
   - Example: "Generate a PDF report of all data lineages"
   - Example: "Compare two versions of the same package"

7. **Human-in-the-Loop needs:**
   - What operations should require approval?
   - Should the agent ask for clarification when uncertain?

8. **Output preferences:**
   - Do you need PDF reports? Excel exports?
   - Should the agent create documentation automatically?
   - Do you want data flow diagrams in SVG?

### **Performance & Scale:**

9. **How many packages do you typically analyze?**
   - Impacts: Memory usage, query performance, visualization complexity

10. **Response time expectations:**
    - Is 5-10 seconds acceptable for complex queries?
    - Should we optimize for speed or quality?
