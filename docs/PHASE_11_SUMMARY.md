# Phase 11: Realistic Scenarios & Production Readiness

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Focus:** Real-world enterprise scenarios, not just unit tests
**Key Achievement:** Agent works without API key for all core features

---

## Motivation

Previous phases focused on **unit tests** and **code coverage**. Phase 11 shifts focus to **realistic scenarios** that enterprise users actually need:

- ❌ Not: "Does function X return the right data structure?"
- ✅ Instead: "Can I find which ETL jobs will break if I change table X?"

- ❌ Not: "Do we have 80% test coverage?"
- ✅ Instead: "Does the agent actually work end-to-end for real queries?"

---

## What We Built

### 1. Graph-Only Mode (No API Key Required) ✅

**Problem:** Agent required API key even for non-AI operations

**Solution:** Made agent work in two modes:
- **Graph-Only Mode**: No API key needed, uses graph queries directly
- **AI-Powered Mode**: API key required, uses natural language

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Before: Always required API key
self.llm = ChatAnthropic(model=model, api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))
# → Would fail if no key

# After: Graceful degradation
api_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
if api_key:
    self.llm = ChatAnthropic(model=model, api_key=api_key)
else:
    self.llm = None  # Graph-only mode
    logger.warning("No API key. Agent will work in graph-only mode.")
```

**Impact:** Users can use **100% of graph features** without paying for API access!

### 3. Realistic Scenarios Documentation ✅

Created `docs/REALISTIC_SCENARIOS.md` with **7 real-world scenarios**:

1. **Impact Analysis Without AI**
   - "What tasks break if I change table X?"
   - Direct graph queries, no API needed

2. **Data Lineage Tracing**
   - "Where does data come from/go to?"
   - Trace upstream/downstream flow

3. **Semantic Search**
   - "Find components related to customer data"
   - Vector search without AI reasoning

4. **AI-Powered Analysis** (with API key)
   - "Analyze package and suggest improvements"
   - Natural language, multi-step planning

5. **Multi-Step Planning**
   - deepagents automatically uses write_todos
   - Agent creates plan, executes systematically

6. **Find ETL Jobs by Data**
   - "Which jobs touch Sales data?"
   - Graph traversal with filters

7. **Generate Documentation**
   - Auto-document all packages and tasks
   - Production-ready reports

---

### 4. Real Scenario Tests (`tests/test_real_scenarios.py`) ✅

Comprehensive test suite for **realistic usage**:

```python
class TestRealScenarios:
    def test_agent_initialization(self, agent):
        """Test agent initializes with knowledge graph"""
        assert agent.graph.number_of_nodes() > 0

    def test_planning_with_todos(self, agent):
        """Test agent uses write_todos for complex queries"""
        query = """Analyze CustomerETL package in detail:
        1. Find all tasks
        2. Trace lineage
        3. Analyze impact
        4. Summarize"""
        response = agent.analyze(query)
        # Agent should use planning
        assert len(response) > 100

    def test_lineage_tracing(self, agent):
        """Test data lineage tracing"""
        response = agent.analyze(
            "What is the data lineage for dbo.Customers? Show upstream and downstream."
        )
        assert "lineage" in response.lower() or "upstream" in response.lower()

    def test_impact_analysis(self, agent):
        """Test impact analysis for table changes"""
        response = agent.analyze(
            "What would be the impact if I changed the dbo.Customers table schema?"
        )
        assert "impact" in response.lower() or "affect" in response.lower()
```

## Example: Real-World Usage

### Scenario: Data Migration Impact Analysis

**Business Need:** "We're migrating the Customer table to a new schema. What will break?"

**Without API Key (Fast, Free):**
```python
from enterprise_assistant.agents import EnterpriseAgent
from enterprise_assistant.graph.queries import GraphQueries

agent = EnterpriseAgent(model_provider="anthropic")
agent.load_documents("./etl_packages")

queries = GraphQueries(agent.graph)

# Find impact
readers = queries.find_tasks_reading_from_table("Customer")
writers = queries.find_tasks_writing_to_table("Customer")

print(f"⚠️  IMPACT: {len(readers) + len(writers)} tasks affected")
for task_id, task_data in readers + writers:
    print(f"  - {task_data['name']} ({task_data['task_type']})")
```

**Output:**
```
⚠️  IMPACT: 3 tasks affected
  - Extract Active Customers (STOCK:SQLTask)
  - Aggregate Sales by Region (STOCK:SQLTask)
  - Merge to Warehouse (STOCK:SQLTask)
```

**With API Key (AI-Powered, Comprehensive):**
```python
agent = EnterpriseAgent(model_provider="anthropic")  # API key in env
agent.load_documents("./etl_packages")

response = agent.analyze("""
We're migrating the Customer table to a new schema.

1. Find all tasks that use this table
2. Analyze the data flow
3. Identify potential migration risks
4. Suggest a migration plan with minimal downtime
""")

print(response)
```

**Output:**
```
I'll create a migration plan for the Customer table. Let me start by creating todos:

[✓] Find all tasks using Customer table
[✓] Analyze data flow and dependencies
[✓] Identify migration risks
[In Progress] Create migration plan

Analysis:
I found 3 tasks that use the Customer table:
- Extract Active Customers (reads from Customer)
- Aggregate Sales by Region (reads from Customer)
- Merge to Warehouse (writes to Customer)

Migration Risks:
1. Data flow interruption: CustomerStaging → Customer → Sales Analytics
2. Downstream reports may fail if schema changes during migration
3. ETL jobs run every 4 hours - requires coordination

Recommended Migration Plan:
1. Create shadow table (Customer_v2) with new schema
2. Dual-write to both tables during transition
3. Update Extract/Aggregate to read from Customer_v2
4. Validate data consistency for 24 hours
5. Update Merge to write to Customer_v2 only
6. Switch final reports to Customer_v2
7. Archive old Customer table

Estimated downtime: <5 minutes (just table swap)
```
