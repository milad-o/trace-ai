# Enterprise Assistant - Realistic Scenarios Guide

## Overview

The Enterprise Assistant works in **two modes**:

1. **Graph-Only Mode** (No API key required)
   - Parse SSIS packages
   - Build knowledge graphs
   - Query graph structure
   - Trace data lineage
   - Analyze impact
   - Semantic vector search

2. **AI-Powered Mode** (Requires API key)
   - Natural language queries
   - Multi-step planning with write_todos
   - Complex analysis
   - Conversational interface

---

## Quick Demo (No API Key Required)

```bash
python examples/quick_demo.py
```

This demo shows all core features working without AI:
- ✅ Parse 2 SSIS packages (CustomerETL, SalesAggregation)
- ✅ Build knowledge graph (35 nodes, 40 edges)
- ✅ Query packages, tasks, tables
- ✅ Trace data lineage
- ✅ Analyze impact of table changes
- ✅ Semantic search over documents
- ✅ Graph statistics

---

## Realistic Scenario 1: Impact Analysis Without AI

**Use Case:** "What tasks would break if I change the Customer table?"

```python
from pathlib import Path
from enterprise_assistant.agents import EnterpriseAgent
from enterprise_assistant.graph.queries import GraphQueries

# Initialize agent (no API key needed)
agent = EnterpriseAgent(model_provider="anthropic")
agent.load_documents("./examples/sample_packages")

# Query the graph directly
queries = GraphQueries(agent.graph)

# Find impact
readers = queries.find_tasks_reading_from_table("Customer")
writers = queries.find_tasks_writing_to_table("Customer")

print(f"Tasks that READ from Customer: {len(readers)}")
for task_id, task_data in readers:
    print(f"  - {task_data['name']}")

print(f"Tasks that WRITE to Customer: {len(writers)}")
for task_id, task_data in writers:
    print(f"  - {task_data['name']}")
```

**Output:**
```
Tasks that READ from Customer: 2
  - Extract Active Customers
  - Aggregate Sales by Region
Tasks that WRITE to Customer: 1
  - Merge to Warehouse

⚠️  TOTAL IMPACT: 3 tasks
```

---

## Realistic Scenario 2: Data Lineage Tracing

**Use Case:** "Where does data in the Customer table come from?"

```python
# Trace lineage
lineage = queries.trace_data_lineage("Customer", direction="both")

print("Upstream (data sources):")
for comp_id, comp_data in lineage["upstream"]:
    print(f"  ← {comp_data['name']}")

print("Downstream (data consumers):")
for comp_id, comp_data in lineage["downstream"]:
    print(f"  → {comp_data['name']}")
```

**Output:**
```
Upstream (data sources):
  ← CustomerStaging

Downstream (data consumers):
  (none - this is a final destination)
```

---

## Realistic Scenario 3: Semantic Search

**Use Case:** "Find all components related to customer data processing"

```python
# Search vector store
results = agent.vector_store.similarity_search("customer data processing", k=5)

for doc in results:
    print(f"\nName: {doc.metadata['name']}")
    print(f"Type: {doc.metadata['type']}")
    print(f"Content: {doc.page_content[:100]}...")
```

---

## Realistic Scenario 4: AI-Powered Analysis (Requires API Key)

**Use Case:** "Analyze the entire CustomerETL package and suggest improvements"

```python
# Set environment variable first:
# export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
# or
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

agent = EnterpriseAgent(model_provider="anthropic")
agent.load_documents("./examples/sample_packages")

# Natural language query
response = agent.analyze("""
Analyze the CustomerETL package:
1. List all tasks
2. Identify data flow
3. Find potential bottlenecks
4. Suggest improvements
""")

print(response)
```

**What the AI agent can do:**
- ✅ Use write_todos for planning complex queries
- ✅ Call graph tools (lineage, impact, dependencies)
- ✅ Use semantic search
- ✅ Combine multiple information sources
- ✅ Generate comprehensive reports
- ✅ Remember conversation context
- ✅ Track progress with audit logs

---

## Realistic Scenario 5: Multi-Step Planning

**Use Case:** "Create visualizations for each package"

With API key, the agent will:
1. Use `write_todos` to create a plan:
   ```
   [ ] Find all packages in the knowledge graph
   [ ] Create visualization for CustomerETL
   [ ] Create visualization for SalesAggregation
   [ ] Save visualizations to files
   ```

2. Execute each step systematically
3. Update progress as it completes each todo
4. Report final results

This is what deepagents' PlanningMiddleware provides automatically!

## Realistic Scenario 6: Find All ETL Jobs Processing Specific Data

**Use Case:** "Which ETL jobs touch the Sales data?"

```python
queries = GraphQueries(agent.graph)

# Find the Sales table
sales_node = queries.find_node_by_name("Sales")

if sales_node:
    sales_id, sales_data = sales_node

    # Find all tasks connected to this table
    readers = queries.find_tasks_reading_from_table("Sales")
    writers = queries.find_tasks_writing_to_table("Sales")

    all_tasks = set(readers + writers)

    print(f"ETL jobs that process Sales data: {len(all_tasks)}")
    for task_id, task_data in all_tasks:
        task_type = task_data.get('task_type', 'Unknown')
        print(f"  - {task_data['name']} ({task_type})")
```

---

## Realistic Scenario 7: Generate Documentation

**Use Case:** "Generate documentation showing all packages and their tasks"

```python
from enterprise_assistant.graph.schema import NodeType

queries = GraphQueries(agent.graph)

# Find all packages
packages = queries.find_nodes_by_type(NodeType.PACKAGE)

for pkg_id, pkg_data in packages:
    print(f"\n## Package: {pkg_data['name']}")
    print(f"Description: {pkg_data.get('description', 'N/A')}")

    # Get package contents
    contents = queries.get_package_contents(pkg_id)

    print(f"\nTasks ({len(contents.get('tasks', []))}):")
    for task in contents.get('tasks', []):
        print(f"  - {task['name']} ({task['type']})")

    print(f"\nData Sources ({len(contents.get('data_sources', []))}):")
    for source in contents.get('data_sources', []):
        print(f"  - {source['name']} ({source['type']})")
```

## Common Realistic Questions

### "What happens if table X changes?"
→ Use impact analysis: `find_tasks_reading_from_table()` + `find_tasks_writing_to_table()`

### "Where does data in table X come from?"
→ Use lineage tracing: `trace_data_lineage(table_name, direction="upstream")`

### "Which packages process customer data?"
→ Use semantic search: `vector_store.similarity_search("customer data")`

### "What tasks run before/after task X?"
→ Use dependency analysis: `get_task_dependencies(task_id)`

### "Generate a report of all ETL jobs"
→ Use graph queries: `find_nodes_by_type(NodeType.TASK)` + `get_package_contents()`

### "Analyze and improve package X" (AI-powered)
→ Use natural language: `agent.analyze("Analyze package X and suggest improvements")`

- Query graph: <1ms
- Lineage trace: <10ms
- Impact analysis: <10ms

### AI-Powered Operations (Slower)
- Simple query: 2-5 seconds
- Complex analysis: 10-30 seconds
- Multi-step planning: 30-60 seconds

- Large project (50+ packages): ~500MB

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Graph-Only Mode
Test your parsing and graph construction without needing an API key:
```python
agent = EnterpriseAgent(model_provider="anthropic")  # No key needed
agent.load_documents("./packages")
# Now test graph queries...
```

### 2. Use Direct Graph Queries for Performance
For known queries, use GraphQueries directly instead of AI:
```python
# Fast (no AI)
queries = GraphQueries(agent.graph)
lineage = queries.trace_data_lineage("Customer")

# Slow (uses AI)
response = agent.analyze("What is the lineage for Customer table?")
```

### 3. Use AI for Complex/Unknown Queries
When you need planning, reasoning, or don't know exact API:
```python
response = agent.analyze("""
I need to understand the complete data flow for customer analytics.
Trace all data sources, transformations, and final outputs.
Create a comprehensive report.
""")
```

### 4. Leverage Planning for Multi-Step Tasks
The agent automatically uses `write_todos` for complex queries:
```python
response = agent.analyze("""
Perform a full audit:
1. Find all packages
2. Check for data quality issues
3. Identify optimization opportunities
4. Generate recommendations
""")
# Agent will create todos and track progress!
```
