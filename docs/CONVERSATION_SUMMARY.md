# üí¨ Let's Talk - Enterprise Assistant Capabilities

## üìã Quick Answers to Your Questions

### **Q: Can we ask the agent to create SVG/PNG graph of a package?**
**A: Not yet, but we can easily add it! ‚ú®**

**What we have:**
- ‚úÖ NetworkX has `draw()`, `draw_networkx()`, `draw_hierarchical()` functions
- ‚úÖ Can export to GraphML (for external tools like Gephi, yEd)
- ‚úÖ Knowledge graph already built with full structure

**What we need to add:**
- ‚ùå A visualization tool for the agent
- ‚ùå Matplotlib or Graphviz integration
- ‚ùå SVG/PNG export function

**Implementation effort:** ~2 hours
```python
def create_graph_visualization(
    package_name: str,
    output_format: str = "svg",  # svg, png, pdf
    layout: str = "hierarchical"  # hierarchical, spring, circular
) -> str:
    """Generate visual graph of package structure."""
    # Uses NetworkX + matplotlib or graphviz
    # Returns file path to generated image
```

### **Q: What capabilities does our enterprise agent have?**
**A: See full assessment in [CAPABILITY_ASSESSMENT.md](CAPABILITY_ASSESSMENT.md)**

**TL;DR - We can:**
- ‚úÖ Parse SSIS packages and build knowledge graphs (35 nodes, 40 edges)
- ‚úÖ Answer questions using AI agent with 6 tools
- ‚úÖ Hybrid intelligence (graph queries + semantic search)
- ‚úÖ Trace data lineage upstream/downstream
- ‚úÖ Analyze impact of changes
- ‚úÖ Stream responses (see thinking process)
- ‚úÖ CLI interface with interactive sessions

**We cannot yet:**
- ‚ùå Generate graph visualizations (SVG/PNG)
- ‚ùå Remember conversations across sessions
- ‚ùå Use planning tool (write_todos) - it exists but not configured
- ‚ùå Delegate to specialized subagents
- ‚ùå Generate PDF reports
- ‚ùå Compare multiple packages side-by-side

---

### **Q: Can we have a proper chat?**
**A: Currently limited, but fixable! üß†**

**Current state:**
- ‚úÖ Basic interactive CLI session
- ‚úÖ Single-turn Q&A works
- ‚ùå No memory between queries
- ‚ùå No session persistence
- ‚ùå Can't reference previous answers

**What it feels like now:**
```
User: What documents do we have?
Agent: CustomerETL and SalesAggregation

User: Tell me more about the first one
Agent: [doesn't remember "first one" = CustomerETL] ‚ùå
```

**What we need for proper chat:**
1. **Conversation Memory Middleware** - Track conversation history
2. **Checkpointing** - Persist sessions across restarts
3. **Context References** - "it", "that one", "the previous answer"

**Implementation effort:** ~4 hours for basic memory, ~8 hours for full chat experience

### **Q: How does write_todos work in deepagent?**
**A: It's a planning tool - let me explain! üìã**

**From the docs:**
> "This tool doesn't actually do anything - it is just a way for the agent to come up with a plan"

**How it works:**
1. Agent breaks down complex query into subtasks
2. Calls `write_todos` to create task list
3. Executes tasks one by one
4. Can reference the plan during execution

**Example scenario:**
```
User: Analyze all packages and create a detailed report with visualizations

Agent (internally):
  [Calls write_todos]
  Todo 1: Load all packages from directory
  Todo 2: Build knowledge graph
  Todo 3: Analyze each package structure
  Todo 4: Generate comparison table
  Todo 5: Create visualization for each package
  Todo 6: Write comprehensive markdown report

  [Executes each todo sequentially]
```

**Current status:**
- ‚úÖ Tool is available (automatically added by deepagent)
- ‚ùå Not instructed to use it (not in agent instructions)
- ‚ùå No progress tracking visible to user

**To enable:**
```python
instructions = """You are an expert enterprise document analyst.

For complex multi-step queries:
1. First, use write_todos to break down the task
2. Show the user your plan
3. Execute each step systematically
4. Reference your todos as you progress

When you create a plan, show it like:
üìã Plan:
- [ ] Step 1: ...
- [ ] Step 2: ...
"""
```

### **Q: Tell me about deepagent's middlewares**
**A: Three built-in middlewares! üîß**

#### **1. Planning Middleware (write_todos tool)**
- **What:** Automatically adds task planning capability
- **How:** Agent can call `write_todos` to create task lists
- **Use case:** Complex multi-step analysis
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Available, ‚ö†Ô∏è Not utilized

#### **2. Filesystem Middleware (virtual files)**
- **Tools:** `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`
- **How:** Simulates filesystem in LangGraph State
- **Virtual:** Doesn't touch real filesystem
- **Use case:** Store intermediate results, create reports
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Available, ‚ö†Ô∏è Not utilized

**Example:**
```python
# Agent can do this automatically:
agent: "I'll analyze the packages and save findings to report.md"
[calls write_file("report.md", "# Analysis Report\n...")]

# Access the file
result = agent.invoke({"messages": [...]})
report_content = result["files"]["report.md"]
```

#### **3. Subagent Middleware (delegation)**
- **What:** Delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents
- **How:** Define subagents with custom prompts/tools
- **Use case:** Domain expertise, context quarantine
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Available, ‚ùå Not configured

**Potential subagents:**
```python
subagents = [
    {
        "name": "lineage-analyst",
        "description": "Expert at tracing data lineage",
        "prompt": "You specialize in data flow analysis...",
        "tools": [lineage_tracer, graph_query]
    },
    {
        "name": "visualization-expert",
        "description": "Creates graphs and diagrams",
        "prompt": "You create clear visualizations...",
        "tools": [create_graph_viz, export_svg]
    },
    {
        "name": "documentation-writer",
        "description": "Writes technical documentation",
        "prompt": "You write clear, comprehensive docs...",
        "tools": [write_file, edit_file, semantic_search]
    }
]
```

## ü§î Questions for You

### **Immediate Priorities:**

1. **Graph Visualization:**
   - Do you need the agent to generate SVG/PNG graphs?
   - What layout style? (hierarchical tree, force-directed, circular)
   - Should it show all 35 nodes or focus on specific package?
   - Interactive (web-based zoom/pan) or static images?

2. **Conversational Chat:**
   - How important is conversation memory?
   - Should it remember context within a session only, or persist across restarts?
   - Do you want a web-based chat UI or stick with CLI?

3. **Planning & Todos:**
   - Should the agent show its plan before executing complex queries?
   - Do you want to approve the plan first? (human-in-the-loop)
   - Should it show progress as it executes each step?

   Examples:
   - "I have 50 SSIS packages and need to find all uses of CustomerTable"
   - "Generate a PDF report with data flow diagrams for each package"
   - "Compare Package_v1 and Package_v2 and show what changed"
   - "Find circular dependencies in my ETL workflow"

8. **Frustrations:**
   - What's frustrating about the current system?
   - What takes too long?
   - What requires too many steps?

### **Interaction Style:**

9. **How do you want to interact with the system?**
   - [ ] CLI (current approach)
   - [ ] Web-based chat interface (Streamlit/Gradio)
   - [ ] Jupyter notebook integration
   - [ ] REST API (for custom integrations)
   - [ ] VS Code extension

10. **Response time expectations:**
    - Is 5-10 seconds acceptable for complex queries?
    - Do you prefer fast approximate answers or slower detailed analysis?
    - Should the agent stream progress (show thinking) or just return final answer?
